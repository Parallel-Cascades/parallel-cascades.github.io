description: Highly performant DOTS procedural runtime spherical mesh generation for planet and asteroid shapes. LOD system using Unity Entities Graphics's RenderMeshArray to handle multiple LOD meshes for generated meshes. Triplanar mapping shader for terrain textures blending three textures for flat, steep and high terrain elevation, with a random UV-offset rotation based method to reduce visible texture tiling.
